ðŸ”¹ Breaking Into Tech | Product Designer (UI/UX) ðŸ”¹

My journey into tech began in 2024 when I enrolled into the DEVCAREER TECH PROGRAM Which was powered by UK-Nigeria Tech Hub and delivered by AltSchool Africa. There, I was introduced to the world of Product Design (UI/UX)â€”a field that instantly captured my interest and creativity.

Using Figma, I learned how to bring ideas to life through user-centered design, wire framing, prototyping, and building intuitive digital experiences. Every class, project, and feedback session helped sharpen my eye for design and improve my ability to think from the user's perspective.

After successfully completing the program, I earned a certificate in Product Design, marking my first milestone in the tech industry. But this is just the beginning.

Iâ€™m currently exploring real-world projects, learning to collaborate in tech teams, and growing my skill set every day. My goal is to build impactful digital products that make life easier for peopleâ€”one screen at a time.
